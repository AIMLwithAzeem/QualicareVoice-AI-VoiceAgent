# QualicareVoice-AI-VoiceAgent
In today’s fast-paced world, losing a potential customer due to slow response or missed calls is one of the biggest revenue leaks for service businesses.
## QualicareVoice is an advanced AI-powered system that qualifies leads, verifies insurance, books appointments, and hands off to humans — all in real time.
This project demonstrates production-grade automation, combining Conversational AI, workflow orchestration, scheduling, and API integrations.

💡 **Zero Lead Drop Pipeline**

This is not a simple chatbot — it is a fully autonomous voice-driven operations engine powered by Vapi, n8n, Twilio, and Google Sheets.

**1. Smart Lead Intake (Vapi)**

The AI voice agent naturally collects:

- Caller Name

* Phone Number

+ Insurance Provider

- Service Required

**2. Instant Insurance Verification (Google Sheets + n8n)**

- Checks the caller’s insurance against an approved database

* Fully automated

+ Logged for transparency

**3. Dual-Path Decision Logic**

✅ **Qualified Lead (Hot Path)**

- Books the next available calendar slot

+ Sends SMS confirmation via Twilio

* Notifies admin/agent

- Logs lead as BOOKED

❌ **Unqualified Lead (Cold Path)**

- AI informs the user that a human will follow up

* Sends email notification to admin

+ Logs lead as UNQUALIFIED

**4. Error-Proof Response Handling**

A binary-safe response bridge ensures Vapi always receives a clean, parseable output — preventing JSON or formatting issues.
